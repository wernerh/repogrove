## [Unreleased]

### Added
- 2026-09-27 — Factory bootstrap: repo scaffold, operating docs (CLAUDE.md,
  PROJECT_STATE.md, PRODUCT.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, ADRs), CI + guardrail workflows,
  factory state/decision files, initial roadmap issues. (dev)
- 2026-09-27 — `docs/design/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` v1: WCAG 2.1 AA-validated color/type/
  spacing/radius/elevation/motion tokens (light + dark theme) and component pattern
  specs (repo/Grove card, alternatives table, status/momentum chips, dates,
  loading/empty/error states, page headers); `docs/design/tokens/generate_palette.py`,
  the reproducible generator behind every quoted color value; `docs/design/
  UX-PRINCIPLES.md` journeys per persona. Documentation only — not yet wired into a
  Tailwind config (no app scaffolded yet, issue #5). PR #9. (design)

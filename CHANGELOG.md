## [Unreleased]

### Added
- 2026-09-27 — Factory bootstrap: repo scaffold, operating docs (CLAUDE.md,
  PROJECT_STATE.md, PRODUCT.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, ADRs), CI + guardrail workflows,
  factory state/decision files, initial roadmap issues. (dev)
- 2026-09-27 — `docs/design/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` v1: WCAG 2.1 AA-validated color/type/
  spacing/radius/elevation/motion tokens (light + dark theme) and component pattern
  specs (repo/Grove card, alternatives table, status/momentum chips, dates,
  loading/empty/error states, page headers); `docs/design/tokens/generate_palette.py`,
  the reproducible generator behind every quoted color value; `docs/design/
  UX-PRINCIPLES.md` journeys per persona. Documentation only — not yet wired into a
  Tailwind config (no app scaffolded yet, issue #5). PR #9. (design)
- 2026-09-27 — Phase 1 walking skeleton: Next.js 16 App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind
  scaffold under `/src`, statically exported (`output: "export"`, per ADR-002/RG-2 —
  Azure Storage static-website hosting has no server runtime); `/content` loader
  (`src/lib/content.ts`, `gray-matter`) that validates frontmatter and fails the build
  loudly on a missing/invalid field or a duplicate `github` value; homepage plus
  `/grove/[slug]` and `/repo/[slug]` pages, statically generated for every Grove/repo
  currently in `/content` (`ai`, `self-hosted`, `ollama`, `supabase`) via
  `generateStaticParams` — no hardcoded routes. Markdown bodies render through
  `react-markdown` (no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`). 23 Vitest unit/render tests; `npm run
  lint`/`test`/`build` all green locally. Closes #5, #6, #7. (dev)
